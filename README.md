Learn the different ways to write API calls

Welcome to the Api_helper! This repository is dedicated to teaching and demonstrating various API calls using the Yext Management APIs, specifically focusing on content entities. This repository will guide you through the nuances of API calls, including GET, PUT, loops, and more.

## Getting Started
**Prerequisites**: Before you begin, ensure you have downloaded your IDE of choice (my examples are in Jupyter Notebook) and have the following libraries installed
- requests library
- JSON library
**Configuration**: Make sure you have created an app within your demo account that has access read / write permissions to the entities and locations Management API endpoint

## Usage
Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll find in this repository:

GET Calls: Learn how to retrieve data from individual entities or accounts.
PUT Calls: Understand how to update or modify existing data.
Loops in API Calls: Discover how to use loops for pulling or retrieving data from multiple sub accounts at once.
